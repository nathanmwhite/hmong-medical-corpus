hmong-medical-corpus/question_categorization/

This folder contains code and ancillary materials related to question categorization in Hmong.

The folder contains one code file so far, harness.py. This code file provides the training harness for training a question classification model; it is currently in raw script form, to be updated to a class-based production-grade module.
