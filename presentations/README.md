hmong-medical-corpus/presentations/

This folder contains Jupyter Notebook presentations featuring aspects of the construction of the Hmong Medical Corpus to provide an orientation for researchers to be able to construct corpora for their work along the same lines. These will be converted to html form for the Hmong Medical Corpus blog at https://hmcorpus.home.blog/.

There are currently two Jupyter Notebook files:
1) Medical_Corpus_Database_Presentation.ipynb--Features method of constructing the corpus database.
2) POS_tagger_feature.ipynb--Features method of POS-tagging for the corpus.
